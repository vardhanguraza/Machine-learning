# Machine-learning
Experiment with regression and classification algorithms and 
learning various machine learning methods and algorithms such as linear 
and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, clustering, feature
selection and transformation methods, Reinforcement learning, etc. I will also be using standard
implementation of these algorithms using readily available libraries in R or Python for various
assignments.
