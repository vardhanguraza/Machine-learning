In this assignment, you will implement the following clustering algorithms:
  1. K-means
  2. Expectation Maximization
In addition, you will implement the following feature dimensionality reduction algorithms
1. Any one feature selection algorithm (decision tree, forward selection, backward elimination,
etc.)
  2. PCA
  3. ICA
  4. Randomized Projections
You must use R or Python for this assignment. You can use any publicly available R or Python
library/package. You can even use H2O.
For the following tasks, use the same two datasets that you used in assignment 3.
Tasks:
  1. Run the clustering algorithms on your datasets and describe your observations (with plots).
  2. Apply the dimensionality reduction algorithms on your datasets and describe your observations
  (with plots).
  3. Run the clustering algorithms again, this time after applying dimensionality reduction. Describe
  the difference compared to previous experimentation (with plots).
  4. Run your neural network learner from assignment 3 on the data after dimensionality reduction
  (from task 2). Explain and plot your observations (error rates, etc.)
  5. Use the clustering results from task 1 as the new features and apply neural network learner on
  this new data consisting of only clustering results as features and class label as the output.
  Again, plot and explain your results.
