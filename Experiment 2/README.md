In this assignment, you are required to implement three learning algorithms:
1. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
2. Decision trees
3. Boosting
You must use R or Python for this assignment. You can use any publicly available R or Python
library/package. You can even use H2O.
Tasks:
1. You are to use two data sets for this assignment.
a. First data set: Use the data set from assignment 1 as the first data set. Convert it to a
binary classification problem by thresholding the output to a class label. Use this
transformed data set for all the tasks and experiments in this assignment
b. Second data set: Get a data set suitable for classification from anywhere (either publicly
available or your own). The data set should have a reasonable amount of features and
instances. You need to explain why you think this data set and the corresponding
classification problem is interesting.
Divide your data sets in train and test sets.
2. Download and use any support vector machines package for your classification problems. Do it
in such a way that you are able to easily change kernel functions. Experiment with at least two
kernel functions (in addition to linear) of your choice. You can pick any kernels you like (shown
in the class or not).
3. Download and use any decision trees for your classification problems. Experiment with pruning.
You can use information gain or GINI index or any other metric to split on variables. Just be clear
to explain why you used the metric that you used.
4. Implement (or download) a package to use a boosted version of your decision trees. Again,
experiment with pruning.
5. Implement and use cross validation for both your datasets with the above algorithms
