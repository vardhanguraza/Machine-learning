In this assignment, you will be using the following two learning algorithms:
1. Artificial neural networks (ANN)
2. K Nearest Neighbors
You must use R or Python for this assignment. You can use any publicly available R or Python
library/package. You can even use H2O.
For the following tasks, use the same two datasets that you used in assignment 2.
Tasks:
1. Download and use any neural networks package to classify your classification problems.
Experiment with number of layers and number of nodes, activation functions (sigmoid, tanh,
etc.), and may be a couple of other parameters.
2. Download and use any KNN package to classify your classification problems. Experiment with
number of neighbors. You can use any distance metric appropriate to your problem. Just be
clear to explain why you used the metric that you used.
